# About this file
Lately I converted both of my Anet A8 Plus printers to be driven by Klipper through Raspberry PI micro computers running Mainsail.
As there doesn't really exist a printer.cfg file for those type of printers I decided to write my own.

# Support
- Adds autohoming through G28 GCode command.
- Adds support for the standard 12864 LCD screen.
